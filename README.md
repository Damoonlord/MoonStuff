# MoonStuff

Collection of Devtool objects i've made, including Sandfall, ColouredOESphere and more. (I may also add Items and Creatures later on)

## Region properties

Currently there are two region properties `DefaultCrystalColor` and `DefaultColouredOESphereColour`.
`DefaultCrystalColor` Uses three decimal values, corresponding to its hue, saturation and lightness respectively.
`DefaultColouredOESphereColour` Has only one decimal value corresponding to its hue.

Examples:
```
DefaultCrystalColor: 0.87, 0.9 0.6
DefaultColouredOESphereColour: 0.45
// you can also use DefaultColoredOESphereColor
```
